## Hi there 👋
🔐 Mission

Building the practical skills to defend digital infrastructure through code, labs, and relentless learning.

Current Focus:
Hands-on cybersecurity training → SOC readiness → Formal Computer Science studies → Professional defense roles.

All projects are for educational growth and ethical security practice.

"First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack."
— George Carrette

This is my cybersecurity journey in code. Welcome.
